commonly used basic hibernate annotations:

@Entity : use to mark any class as entity(will create new table)
@Table : use to change table details
@id : use to mark column as id(primary key)
@GeneratedValue : hibernate will automatically generate values for that using an internal sequence therefore we dont have to set it manually
@Column : can be used to specify column mappings, for example, to change the column name in the associated table in database 
@Transient : this tells database not to save this field
@Temporal : @Temporal over date feild tells hibernate he format in which the dat need sto be saved
@Lob : @Lob tells hibernate that this is a large object, not a simple object



ALSO SOME ADVANCE HIBERNATE ANNOTATIONS:

@OneToOne , @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, etc
